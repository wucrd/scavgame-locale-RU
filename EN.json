This has never been seen before in nature. Not sure we can call them mammals anymore... It proves to me and to <corrupt:0x0001FC> that there is nothing this team cannot do.\n\nI wish to thank everybody who contributed to this amazing feat. It greatly reduces the cost and complexity of their production, as it is not necessary to create and organize separate male and female Sawians. The lack of sex drive also curbs overpopulation and avoids any incidents while still allowing them to reproduce.\n<>\nYou can expect a reward from me soon.\n\nYours in good faith,\n<corrupt:0xFF0BEA>\n<>\n[ATTACHMENTS]\n\nREF: [INTERNAL MEMORANDUM - 25##-12-07-09-12-40-0157]\n\nENTITY CLASS: Biological\nENTITY SUBCLASS: Sawian\n<>\n[CONTENTS]\n\nThis memorandum establishes mandatory terminology policy regarding the Sawian species and supersedes all prior documentation, annotations, and informal usage.\n\nEffective immediately, the term \"hermaphrodite\" is **banned in all corporate communications**, including scientific, operational, cultural, and casual contexts. The sole exception is explicit historical reference (e.g., quotations, legacy documentation analysis, or discussion of obsolete Earth taxonomies), which must be clearly labeled as such.\n\nThe approved descriptor for Sawian reproductive biology is \"gonosimulistic.\"  \nContext-dependent alternatives include \"cosexual\" and \"monoecious.\"\n\nUse of the term outside of these narrow historical contexts is considered inappropriate, reductive, and professionally suspect. This introduces avoidable interpretive risk and will be reviewed under the Stakeholder-Facing Language Control Framework.\n<>\nNo human naturally possesses two fully functional reproductive systems. The appropriate human medical and social term is \"intersex\", not \"hermaphrodite\". The latter term originated from the mythological figure Hermaphroditus and has long been associated with stigma, violence, and dehumanization. This includes the use of this term to refer to animals, thus equating intersex humans with animals. This has thus proven volatile in public, academic, and media-facing environments.\n<>\nThe application of this term to non-human species arose from that same framework and is therefore neither neutral nor acceptable, regardless of biological differences.\n<>\nWhile historical alternatives exist, such as \"eunuch\", \"bisexual\", and \"androgyny\", these have taken on new meanings and connotations and are not appropriate to use in this way either.\n\nDo not project human gender or sex frameworks onto Sawian subjects. Reproductive biology does not imply gender identity, presentation, orientation, or social function.\n\nReproductive terminology is not casual vocabulary and should not be treated as such.\n<>\nThis policy does not constitute a moral position, medical guidance, or cultural endorsement. Its purpose is strictly to ensure consistency, reduce ambiguity, and protect the organization from reputational exposure.\n\n[ATTACHMENTS END]\n\n[END]",

Do you want to know what won't be so easy to explain? WHY 2 FULL SEMI TRUCKS OF DOG FOOD WERE UNLOADED JUST THIS EVENING BY THE WAREHOUSES. What am I supposed to say to <corrupt:0xFA05F2>  eird orders? \"Oh don't worry, it's just because the company had declared record profits this year and wanted to stock up on food for the future\". I'm not joking, that's one of the ideas that I got fro <corrupt:0xFFFFFF> It's like those people are deaf and can't hear their own stupid ideas. What do you mean \"stock up on food\"? We have at most <corrupt:0xFFFFFF> ogs on this site, this one order would be enough to feed them, their pups and their pups pups.

The Sawians- they… they are our golden ticket! The data we have right now would be enough for a Nobel Prize for every single person in this room!\n\n<corrupt:0xFFFFF7>: Yes. That's nine prizes. If we all agreed to donate the cash from those to [<corrupt:0xFFFBc3>], we'd end up with roughly fifteen million dollars. A drop in a bucket compared to the financial black hole that is your idiotic project!<>\n\n[<corrupt:0xFFFFD9> rises from his chair.]\n\n<corrupt:0xFFFFD9>: IDIOTIC?! IDIOTIC?! WE ARE CREATING LIFE! You are a witness to the infancy of a new intelligent species! Our colleagues would *kill* for such an opportunity mere ten years ago!\n\n<corrupt:0xFFFFF7>: Kill? Sure. Pay what you ask? Hell. No.<>\n\n<corrupt:0xFFFFD9>: Is it always money with you? Fine! We are making money! Even our plushie line is more than enough to cover-\n\n<corrupt:0xFFFFF7>: Pay more than cash, you cretin! The moment this whole affair ends up on some nosy journalist's desk, we will all pay with our *lives.* Hell, our families will be lynched. Besides, the plushies do not require us to keep your colony of… talking rats alive.\n\n<corrupt:0xFFFFD9>: The Sawians are not talking rats!

I could bash someone's head straight open. Introduce the frontal lobe to a hammer. Corner store Braingrow won't help here. Ours will have the fellow walking and talking within a WEEK.
